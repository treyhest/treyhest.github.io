<h1>
    On Erasure
</h1>
<p>
    To promote a view that Christianity is erasure would be disempowering to the Africans that earnestly practic Christianity, and may be an act of erasure itself. Christianity is inextricably entwined with the history and culture of Africa. However, it is important to temper that expectation against the reality of the origins of many of these texts, of which many are problematically published by religious institutions of the time.
