<h1>An Exploration of Christianity in Africa</h1>

<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
<p>
    In line with the <a href="https://onemorevoice.org/index.html">One More Voice Project</a>, which seeks to record and promote the oft-neglected voices, we seek here to promote oft-forgotten visions, and while some of these authors may be very-well published, the ideas and perspectives seen still deserve a wider audience, not relagated to the physical confines and institutional boundaries of a university.
</p>

<h2>About</h2>
<p>
    This project is a experimental (unfinished) Digital Humanities project, developed over the course of the University of Nebraska's Advanced Topics in Digital Humanities Course.
    Here you can find an interactive timeline of collated texts that orbit around three, thematically contrasting, themes about Early Christianity in Colonial Africa.
